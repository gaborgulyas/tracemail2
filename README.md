Tracemail rewritten

The new version of TraceMail uses the DataMaps project available on Github as its new map which offers higher detail and a better look.

The geolocation database has been changed to an online one due to file size limitations. The database is from http://ip-api.com/

The add-on has been updated to support the latest beta version of Thunderbird which implements the new API.
The version for the old API is version v1.2.
The version for the new API is version v2.0.
